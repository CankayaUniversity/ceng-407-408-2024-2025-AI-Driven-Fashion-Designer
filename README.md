# AI-Driven Fashion Designer
This project aims to develop an AI-based fashion design system that replicates the creative process of fashion designers. It integrates Multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized fashion designs using visual and
textual data from fashion retailers. The system collects images of products, style references, and descriptions, processed into unified embeddings
using models like CLIP. These embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval, while generative models create outfit designs
blending historical influences with modern trends. Users can interact with the system through natural language queries for design suggestions,
with LLMs providing personalized recommendations.

The system's architecture consists of a React frontend for interactive design refinement and a Flask backend for handling API requests and model
management. The recommendation engine uses user profiles, different trends, and fashion data to tailor suggestions, ensuring that the outfit
designs are commercially viable. This iterative process allows users to adjust designs in real-time, offering a seamless collaboration experience
with AI. Incorporating fashion domain information, the system ensures that the designs meet industry standards, and cultural influences, allowing
the AI to generate outfit ideas and designs that reflect both innovation and relevance.
