# Multimodal RAG-Based Product Recommendation System
This project focuses on developing a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for personalized recommendations in the
fashion and cosmetics domains. The system integrates advanced AI techniques, including LLMs (Large Language Models) and multimodal
embeddings, to suggest eco-friendly and trending products based on user preferences. By combining textual descriptions, product images,
sustainability certifications, and trend data, the system creates a comprehensive, user-driven recommendation platform.

Key components of the project include a Flask-based backend for API management, a React frontend for user interaction, and a vector
database to store multimodal embeddings efficiently. Leveraging technologies like OpenAI API, Gemini, and embedding services such as
Hugging Face, the system enables real-time recommendations with enhanced accuracy and relevance. This platform aims to bridge the gap in
sustainable fashion and cosmetics by offering environmentally conscious, trend-aware, and user-personalized suggestions through a user-friendly
web interface.
